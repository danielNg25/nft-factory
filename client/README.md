# Frontend

I haven't touch any front code for more than 1 year. This is just like a proof for the working of smart contract.

What I used:

-   `ReactJs`: The only frontend framework that I experienced before
-   `Thirdweb`: The framework that I decide to use after asking for advise from one of my friend
-   `ethereum-multicall`: Use to read onchain data with minimal requests
